# Spine Animation Player and exporter

This is a simple HTML page that loads a Spine animation using the spine-webgl library and play it.

It also allows you to export the animation as a APNG using UPNG.js.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `spine-webgl.html` file in your browser
3. Play the animation
4. Export the animation as a APNG

Unfortunatly, the quality of spine in webgl is not very good
